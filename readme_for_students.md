## Classroom instruction notes

Before class:
- Prepare one ESP32/ESP8266 per group.
- Ensure MicroPython firmware installed.
- Provide each group with `main.py` but ask them to fill in `secrets.py` (local) with credentials.

During lab:
- Demonstrate how to add CallMeBot contact and request API key from their phone.
- Show how to upload `main.py` using Thonny / WebREPL.
- Discuss privacy: the free CallMeBot API allows sending messages only to the same phone number (no spamming).
